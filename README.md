# Leetcode-Solutions-JAVA-Javascript
Collection of LeetCode questions to ace the coding interview!

After spending an hour or more trying to solve the problem, we give up and quickly rush into the solution. This can be a huge barrier in our preparation, since it prevents us from developing our creativity and thinking process.

So, here is what you can do instead ⭐:
Whenever you're unable to solve a problem even after devoting a tremendous amount of time, instead of looking at the solution, set the problem aside for a day.

When you re-attempt this problem the next day with a fresh mind, you’ll be able to think of alternative approaches also. You’ll also find that, giving this break to our mind, helps us identify new approaches which we weren’t able to figure out earlier.

That said, even with consistent efforts, progress may be slow, and problems may take hours to solve. But don't let that happen to you!

Question 1
What will you typically need to implement yourself in the programming assignments if you program in C++, Java or Python?


Just the solution of the problem.



We will provide starter files for C++, Java and Python. In most cases, these will contain the implementation of reading the input and writing the output, and you will only need to implement the correct solution to the problem.  

Question 2
Your program in C, C++ or Java thinks that the product of numbers 
50000
50000 and 
50000
50000 is equal to 
−
1794967296
−1794967296. What is the most probable reason?

Integer overflow.

Question 3
Which tests should you perform before submitting a solution to the programming assignment?


Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.


Question 4
Where does the input data come from when you implement a stress test?


You generate valid input data as a part of the stress test implementation.


Question 5
If you submit a solution of a programming assignment, but it does not pass some of the tests, what feedback will you get from the system?


If it is one of the first few tests, you will see the input data, the answer of your program and the correct answer. Otherwise, you will only see either that the answer of your program is wrong or that your program is too slow or that your program uses too much memory.


You will also learn what was the problem: did your program output a wrong answer, or did it work too long, or did it consume too much memory. For the first few tests, you will also see the input data, the output of your program and the correct answer.
