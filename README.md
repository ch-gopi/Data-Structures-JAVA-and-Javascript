Collection of LeetCode questions to ace the coding interview!

After spending an hour or more trying to solve the problem, we give up and quickly rush into the solution. This can be a huge barrier in our preparation, since it prevents us from developing our creativity and thinking process.

So, here is what you can do instead ⭐:
Whenever you're unable to solve a problem even after devoting a tremendous amount of time, instead of looking at the solution, set the problem aside for a day.

When you re-attempt this problem the next day with a fresh mind, you’ll be able to think of alternative approaches also. You’ll also find that, giving this break to our mind, helps us identify new approaches which we weren’t able to figure out earlier.

That said, even with consistent efforts, progress may be slow, and problems may take hours to solve. But don't let that happen to you!

Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.
